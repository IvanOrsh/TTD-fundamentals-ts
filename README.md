## Intro:

init `jest.config.js`: `npx ts-jest config:init`

---

## Four-Phase Test:

- Setup
- Exercise
- Verify
- Teardown

---

## AAA

- **Arrange**: state, services, or SUT (expected, sut)
- **Act**
- **Assert**

---

## F.I.R.S.T Principles

- Principles, not rules
- Better quality tests, that we trust more
- FIRST > DRY or SOLID or (other)
- weight them (FIRST principles) differently for unit/integration/acceptance level tests

- **FAST** - The faster the better (run more ofter, more feedbacK)

  - most tests should be small & in process
  - monitor test speed
  - break out slower tests

- **INDEPENDENT** - independent / isolated form

  - no shared state between tests - use transient fixture
  - isolated / independent from the external environment
  - use AAA
  - no sequence dependencies

- **REPEATABLE** - deterministic results (beware the flickering test)

  - no time dependency
  - no random data dependency
  - each test: set up and arrange its own data
  - Note: in tension with FAST!

- **SELF-VALIDATING** - test either pass or fail

  - the test runner always reports the result

- **THOROUGH** - aim to cover every scenario (raw code coverage is not sufficient)

  - A few acceptance tests (acceptance tests)
  - some integration tests
  - MANY unit tests

---

## The 3 "Laws" of TDD (uncle bob)

1. You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.
2. You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than it is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.
3. You are not allowed to write any more production code that is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.

---

## The Red-Green-Reflect-Refactor Cycle

Red -> Green -> Reflect -> Refactor

---

## Green Bar Pattern: Fake it

Green Bar Pattern: Known ways to get to Green

- Fake it (till you make it): do a fake implementation to get the current test to pass

---

## Equivalence Partitions and Boundaries

- **Equivalence Partition** - A group of values for which the behavior of the code is the same
- **Boundary** - Where two equivalence partitions meet (where code changes from one behavior to another)

- for testing just pick values **at the boundary** and some within

---

## Green Bar Pattern: Triangulation

- **Green Bar Pattern**: Known ways to get to green
- **Triangulation**: Write three tests around a concept to draw the solution
- Fake it -> Fake it -> Make it (triangulate) or just continue faking it

---

## The Stages of Naming

- Naming is important, and difficult!
- Stages:
  1. Nonsense (cake)
  2. Accurate (sum, repository)
  3. Precise (sumOfAllTran, sactionsForA, ccount)
  4. Meaningful (balance) - **intention revealing**, **domain concepts**

---

## Green Bar Patterns

- Green Bar Pattern: Known ways to get to Green

### Green Bar Pattern: One-to-many

- One-to-many: Start with a single item before moving to a collection

### Green Bar Pattern: Obvious (most tempting one to use)

- Obvious: Go ahead and write the obvious implementation
- If it fails, undo and try another path
- Remember to refactor

### Green Bar Pattern: Backout

- Backout: Undo to get back to green
- Ways forward after backout:
  - Learning test (see next pattern)
  - Use Fake It and Triangulation

### Green Bar Pattern: Learning Test

- Learning Test: Try writing an implementation directly in a test to see if it work
- Some Scenarios:
  - During refactoring
  - After a Backout
  - Exploring a new module / API

---

## TTD Gears

- core: FIRST, RedGreenRefactor, Equivalence Partitions and Boundaries
- low: 3 laws of TTD, the stages of naming, Fake It, Triangulation, One-to-many, Learning Test (uncertain, not confident)
- med: Obvious (some familiarity, confidence)
- hight: (familiar domain, confidence)

- rev(reverse): Red / Red / Reverse! (Backout)

---

## Test Doubles

- Two main styles:
  - **London**: heavy use of test doubles
  - **Chicago**: minimize use of test doubles

### Test Doubles: Fakes

- **Fake**: an object with a simplified working implementation (for example, FakeUserRepository that uses in memory list instead of UserRepository that uses db)

**Rules**:

1. Only for indirect input
2. Not used for control
3. Not used for assertions

- Only there because the SUP has to have it to function, but not actually involved.

### Test Doubles: Stubs

- **Stub** - an object that provides predefined data

**Rules**:

1. Can be used for indirect input
2. Can be used for control
3. Not used for assertions

### Test Doubles: Mock

- **Mock** - an object that records calls received, and verifies them against expected calls

**Rules**:

1. Can be used for indirect input
2. Can be used for control
3. Used for assertion

### Test Doubles: Summary

- **Test Double** - A piece of code that replaces some "real" code for purpose of testing.
- **Why?** - So that our tests can be Fast, Isolated and Repeatable
- **Fake** - an object with a simplified working implementation
- **Stub** - an object that provides the predefined data
- **Mock** - an object that records calls received, and verifies them against expected calls.

## SOLID

### Single Responsibility Principle

- **SRP**: "A class should have only one reason to change" (but not only applicable to classes)
  - What is responsibility?
    - **Concerns** - things the code needs to accomplish (e.g a Person with some data fields **and** a Save() method)
    - **Concepts** - ideas represented in the class / module
      - e.g a Person with some characteristics of the person (name, contact number), information about their credit history

### Open / Closed Principle

- **OCP**: "Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification"
  - Open for extension: Can be extended in order to change its behavior
  - Closed for modification: Not necessary to change its source code to make change in behavior
  - The idea: change behavior of the system **only by adding code**

## Liskov Substitution Principle

- **LSP**: "Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types"
  - Code that depends on an abstraction ...
    - Should be able to use **any** implementation of that abstraction
  - Counter-examples:
    - Implement an interface, but _throw_
    - More restrictive validation on the subtypes

## Interface Segregation Principle

- **ISP**: "Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they don't use"
  - Interfaces should be kept as small as possible
    - Will all implementations implement each member?
    - Will all clients need every member?

## Dependency Inversion Principle

- **DIP**:

  - A: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
  - B: Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

- high-level: your core domain
- low-level: not your core domain
- Abstractions: Interfaces, function signatures
- Details: Concrete implementations of abstractions
